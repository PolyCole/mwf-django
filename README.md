This repository is part of my distinction project to achieve honors in Computer Science. In the project, I examined five of the most popular front and back-end web frameworks, took a look at the functionality they provide, where their limitations lie, and how they can be leveraged to produce high-quality web solutions.

This repository in specific is the portion of my project implemented with Django and React. One of the critical things I learned with this implementation in specific is the importance of design patterns. I didn't have a clear idea of my design pattern going into the project and as a result there are portions of this project that can be further improved and refactored. 

If you'd like, you can also see the Laravel & Vue implementation that's another part of this project [here](https://github.com/PolyCole/mwf-laravel).
